# This is my most prized project yet (WIP)
A nice Tetris clone I am making in C++.

## Ternaria
Made by me and my friends [Amilton](https://github.com/AmiltonMn) and [Fernando](https://github.com/FernandoHka).

We used just C and Windows. No libraries, no frameworks, and no experience with game developement. It was fun :)

## Other stuff
- ### [NUKE.EXE](https://github.com/OsvaldoComCH/Nuke)
  - Software created to bully my college's computers and their users;
  - It takes over the mouse and keyboard and starts doing random inputs;
  - Leaks memory and opens threads;
  - Does not damage files;
  - Some people just want to watch the world burn.

- ### [Compressor](https://github.com/OsvaldoComCH/Compressor)
  - Made to hide the content of some files from my co-workers;
  - Trying to learn C++ fstreams and command line arguments;
  - It encrypts the chosen file into a .cmp extension, and tries do decrypt .cmp files;
  - It does not compress anything yet (ironic, given the name);
  - Drop your file into the .exe and have fun.
 
- ### [Vroom-Vroom Autoclicker](https://github.com/OsvaldoComCH/Autoclicker/releases/latest)
  - I wanted an autoclicker and they all sucked, so I made my own. It's easy, fool;

  - Also helped me learn about Windows Common Controls;
  - Uses my own (more precise) Sleep library, AlarmClock;
 
- ### [LibVroomVroom](https://github.com/OsvaldoComCH/LibVroomVroom)
  - My place to dump very optimized subroutines and useful libraries;
  - I will try to optimize them using assembly language;
  - Once I have a bunch of them, I'm compiling them into a DLL.
